*Does JavaScript has classes*

Yes, but it is all syntactic sugar 
JavaScript actually is a prototype-based language

## OOP - it is a prograaming paradigm or style or way of structuring code

## Object 
- collection of properties and methods
like - toLowerCase, UpperCase, Date , Promises

## why use OOP
- code used to messy 
- to cope up from spaghetti code issues

## parts of OOP 
- Object literal {}

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars
- Abstraction - hiding details example- fetch() as it hides the internal functionality 
- Encapsulation - wrap up data , what needed and what not/ ensures that one team can change data representation and algorithms without causing other team's code change.
- Inheritance - ** in prototypes ** ensures code reuse.
- Polymorphism  - poly (many) morphism (swarup)/ objects to behave differently using the same interface.
