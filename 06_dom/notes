difference in .innerHTML, .innerText & .innerContent

Example- 
 <h1 id="title" class="heading">DOM learning on Chai or Code <span style="display: none;"> test and out</span></h1>

innerHTML result = 'DOM learning on Chai or Code <span style="display: none;"> test and out</span>'

innerContent result = 'DOM learning on Chai or Code test and out'

innerText result = 'DOM learning on Chai or Code'

QuerySelector & QuerySelectorAll

QuerySelector = it selects on one element
but,
QuerySelectorAll = it selects all elements in form of nodeList a type of array but not pure array coz if u check in it's prototype it doesn't have map attribute which a array have.

although we have to us it as an arrray like to change or update we need to define through indexing

- if we want to use attributes like map need to convert nodeList to array 1st then use
or else keep using forEach , etc.

How to convert?
using => Array.from(whatever u have to convert)
