difference in .innerHTML, .innerText & .innerContent

Example- 
 <h1 id="title" class="heading">DOM learning on Chai or Code <span style="display: none;"> test and out</span></h1>

innerHTML result = 'DOM learning on Chai or Code <span style="display: none;"> test and out</span>'

innerContent result = 'DOM learning on Chai or Code test and out'

innerText result = 'DOM learning on Chai or Code'

QuerySelector & QuerySelectorAll

QuerySelector = it selects on one element
but,
QuerySelectorAll = it selects all elements in form of nodeList a type of array but not pure array coz if u check in it's prototype it doesn't have map attribute which a array have.

although we have to us it as an arrray like to change or update we need to define through indexing

- if we want to use attributes like map need to convert nodeList to array 1st then use
or else keep using forEach , etc.

How to convert?
using => Array.from(whatever u have to convert)

Why gets Elements in HTML Collection?
Methods for multiple elements: Functions like getElementsByClassName() and getElementsByTagName() are intended to find all elements that share a particular class name or tag name within the document. Since there can be zero, one, or many such elements, the return type is a collection to accommodate all possibilities.

Array-like object: An HTMLCollection is an array-like object that contains a list of HTML elements. It has a length property and allows access to individual elements using an index (e.g., collection[0]). 

Live collection: HTMLCollection objects are "live," meaning they automatically update if the underlying document structure changes (e.g., if elements are added or removed that match the criteria).

A nodelist is a collection of document nodes which includes text nodes , attribute nodes and element nodes. A line break is also counted in nodelist but only first one. All subsequent line breaks are ignored by browser
