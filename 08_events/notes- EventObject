Notes on Events:-
Events are mainly of two types:
Browser Events and Environment Events.

These events tell us things like:
Where the mouse was clicked
The mouse position (X and Y coordinates)
The window’s height and width (viewport)
The time when the event happened (timestamp)

Practice Questions / Applications
Create an application where, when a user clicks on an image or any element, the time of the click (timestamp) is displayed.

Create a div where, whenever the user clicks inside it, a circle appears at the exact click position using the mouse’s X and Y coordinates.

event propagation: false = Bubbling (bottom to top)
                                   true = Capturing (top to bottom)
